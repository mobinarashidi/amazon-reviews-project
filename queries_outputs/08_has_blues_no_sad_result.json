          "review_text": "If I was to pick the very best recent rock blues cds that I have purchased and enjoyed (always a difficult proposition), I would definitely choose Joe Bonamassa's Blues Deluxe, along with Jimmy Thackery's Wild Night Out!, Eric Clapton's From The Cradle, Ronnie Earl's Deep Blues, and Stevie Ray Vaughan's In Step. Blues Deluxe seems all that more amazing because a following blues-tinged Joe Bonamassa cd, You and Me, is a big disapointment compared to the outstanding blues music, vocals, and guitar playing that are found on Blues Deluxe. I've listened to Blues Deluxe a large number of times, and the cd never fails to fascinate my rock blues and blues tastes. Every song on Blues Deluxe is outstanding blues. Joe Bonamassa does a superb job of singing and playing THE BLUES-Blues Deluxe is also among my most treasured blues cds! If you enjor blues and/or rock blues music, I very strongly and confidently recommend Blues Deluxe to you. The cd is so well done that I consider it a masterpiece.John",

The Blues have always been a \"blasphemy\", a walk downtown, a soulful melody, a harsh reality.... etc... The Blues NEVER did adhere to any rules of musical education. The Blues is the Blues because of a feeling, an attitude. This album has all of that attitude, irreverent as it is. Take off that turtle-neck sweater and listen to these grooves. Blues grooves. The only other artist to take the Blues to this level this decade has been G. Love. No, it's not your daddy's Blues.... but it is Blues.... fun Blues.... New Orleans Blues...
